# Paxos Visualization with React/D3

Project for creating a front end visualization for how the Paxos protocol operates

Site is viewable on Github Pages [here](https://casegray24.github.io/paxos/)

For some reading on the protocol that is implemented in the visualization, see [Paxos Made Simple](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/paxos-simple.pdf) and/or [The Part-Time Parliament](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/lamport-paxos.pdf)

### Special Note

React/D3 do not play well together (since they both have their own access patterns to the DOM). [Here](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/02/react-d3-ecosystem/) is a link for further reading that was useful.
